# Project: 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Resources

#### Read or watch:

* [PEP 530 -- Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/hlwtED-iLsdORSgly8DsyQ)
* [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/0OkbObYzCKtO7ZUAxfKvkw)
* [Type-hints for generators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/l4Fnno568VbVIn9GvrFVtQ)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.


## Tasks
### 0. Async Generator
Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.
The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.

### 1. Async Comprehensions
Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.
The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.

### 2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions
Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.
measure_runtime should measure the total runtime and return it.
